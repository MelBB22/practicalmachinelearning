This report is the write up of the end-of-class project in the Practical Machine Learning Coursera course. Quoting from the course website, the purpose of this assignment is as follows.
"One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants."

This report attempt to predict how well someone does the exercises based on the data from the accelerometers on the arm, forearm belot and dumbbell of participants. Quoting from the above website:
"Six young healthy participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E)."
This project looks at the accelerometer data and predicts whether the particpant was performing the activity according to Class A, B, C, D, or E.
